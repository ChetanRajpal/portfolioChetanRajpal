                           <CardText>In this project me and my team analyzed the working/spreading of a 
                               malware name Linux.MulDrop.14 which infected many Raspberry Pis and converted 
                               them to crypto currency mining machine. This Malware got into the pi as ssh ports 
                               were open. Then it installs zmap, sshpass and mining script, it also changed the 
                               default password to long password as most of the users use default username and 
                               password to ssh into the pi. Only way we got to know malware was by determining 
                               password using another non infected linux machine with professional usb write 
                               blocker so that it doesnâ€™t change the state of sdcard. Then we tracked the ssh 
                               records and commands and then recognized how the device was infected.
